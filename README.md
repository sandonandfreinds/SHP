Code repository used to make movies for my Senior Honours Project.

The aim of this project was to create 3D movies of cosmic structure forming. This was done with data from the Legacy Simulation, an N-Body dark matter simulation created by the Tmox group at the Institute for Astronomy. Movies were made of a 100Mpc/h simulation box containing 2048^3 particles as well as a movie of the evolution of an individual dark matter halo in the simulation. The movies show the mass of objects on a colour scale, giving the observer a visual sense of the structures formed by dark matter. 

The codes are written in python using YT and YTREE(https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01881) libraries. The code for the full simulation movie is full_sim_movie.py and the halo movie is halo_evolution.py. Documentation of the functions made to create the movies can be found in movie_functions.py

The the movies can be found at https://vimeo.com/showcase/8324326
The project report "visualising the cosmic web and dark matter halos" is also available.
